# Practice
A dump of my codes from when I was a beginner

This was the very first script I wrote using Python, which was an application of the basics that I learned:
looping, assigning, operations, conditional statements...

Simple looping calculator where you could calculate two numbers to do operations, until you type 'quit'.
It's also error-proof, at least I tried to make it handle errors correctly as much as possible. 
I tried breaking this script as much as possible, until I could no longer break it :)


I've also gone through a lot of different versions of this project, but this is the simplest that I could grind this down to.
I've seen a lot of codes online doing the same thing, not sure how mine stacks up to them,
but I found most of them to be unnecesarily complicated.

Anyway...

This small little project of mine helped me understand that simpler is simply better :)
I think of it like simplifying fractions,
no matter how large a fraction is, it can always be simplified until it cannot be grinded down further

Would've been awesome if I could upload all the previous versions of this, so that one can see how I simplified it down to this...
but I'm new to github and I don't know how to do that, perhaps some other time. 

Now of course this code isn't perfect. I could have probably done something more to simplify this, maybe you have some ideas? 

LIMITATIONS:
This code has one severe limitation. It can only input two numbers. I'm still thinking of a way to make the calculator have infinite inputs.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN v2 and v3:
Not much difference between v2 and v3, except that v3 is probably the 'better' way of doing this. 
I made use of defining functions on v3 not just to test the things I've learned, but also because I think it's more 'scalable' and cleaner this way.
I could just define another function if, say, I wanted to expand into other mathematical operations
