# Practice
A dump of my codes from when I was a beginner

This was the very first script I wrote using Python, which was an application of the basics that I learned:
looping, assigning, operations, conditional statements...

Simple looping calculator where you could calculate two numbers to do operations, until you type 'quit'.



I'v gone through a lot of different versions of this project, but this is the simplest that I could grind this down to.
I've seen a lot of codes online doing the same thing, not sure how mine stacks up to them,
but I found most of them to be unnecesarily complicated: some are defining functions and some are creating unnecesarry variables...

Anyway...

This small little project of mine helped me understand that simpler is simply better :)
I think of it like simplifying fractions,
no matter how large a fraction is, it can always be simplified until it cannot be grinded down further

Would've been awesome if I could upload all the previous versions of this, so that one can see how I simplified it down to this...
but I'm new to github and I don't know how to do that, perhaps some other time. 
(Also I'm not sure if this is even the correct place to be ranting all these stuff... but I don't care about formalities (except when its coding time :^),
I just want to put a location for all my codes... so sorry if I'm a bit green)

Now of course this code isn't perfect. I could have probably done something more to simplify this, maybe you have some ideas? 
I also don't know if I did right in terms of memory management and speed. Not sure if there's a faster way, as I understand simpler doesn't always mean faster.
I kinda wanna practice on these aspects, even if it's not needed at all in such simple scripts.
Also do not know if this is the "pythonic way of doing things", but, I tried to make it as simple and as efficient as possible :)
